# CRUD-app-using-VUE-JS



This repository contains a simple Vue.js CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application. The application uses the Vue.js framework to build a user interface that allows users to perform CRUD operations on a list of users. The application communicates with a fake RESTful API provided by JSON Server to simulate the backend.

Features:

Login and Logout:
Users can log in by providing a username and password. For demo purposes, the default credentials are:
Username: Anshika
Password: Shukla
After logging in, the user can see a welcome message and perform CRUD operations.

CRUD Operations:
Add new users with a username.
Edit existing users' usernames.
Delete users.

User Interface:
The user interface is designed with simplicity in mind.
The UI dynamically updates based on the user's authentication status.

Project Structure:
index.html: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the application.
style.css: The CSS file for styling the application.
script.js: The JavaScript file containing the Vue.js application logic.

Getting Started:
Clone the repository: git clone [repository-url]
Open the index.html file in a web browser.

Dependencies:
Vue.js: https://vuejs.org/
JSON Server: https://github.com/typicode/json-server

Note:
This application uses a fake RESTful API provided by JSON Server. Make sure to install JSON Server and run it using the provided JSON file (db.json) for the application to work.
